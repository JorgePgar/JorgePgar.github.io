## MachingLearning vs MathLearning

This blog is intended to be a storm-thought about some little regions of the math world that I have atempted to understand. For example, there are multiple equivalent formulations of the spectral theorem:

- *Formulation 1*: if $T\in B(H)$ is a self-adjoint element, then there is a spatially implemented *-isomorphism: $\text{von Neumann algebra generated by } T \rightarrow L^\infty(X)$ for some $X\subset \mathbb{R}$, which is indeed the spectrum of $T$.

- *Formulation 2*: under same hypothesis, there is a spectral measure $dE_\lambda$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $T = \int \lambda \, dE_\lambda$. 

- *Other formulations*: using direct integrals of Hilbert spaces, or functional calculus, etc.

Moreover, there are multiple approaches to spectral measures, or how this theorems really generalizes to normal operators and yields (almost) to a classification of abelian von Neumann algebras (at least for the ones that are single-generated).
